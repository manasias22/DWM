# Data-Warehousing-Mining-Lab

Lab Objectives:
1.Learn how to build a data warehouse and query it.
2.Learn about the data sets and data preprocessing.
3.Demonstrate the working of algorithms for data mining tasks such Classification, clustering, Association rule mining & Web mining
4.Apply the data mining techniques with varied input values for different parameters.
5.Explore open source software (like WEKA) to perform data mining tasks.

Lab Outcomes: At the end of the course, the student will be able to
1.Design data warehouse and perform various OLAP operations.
2.Implement data mining algorithms like classification.
3.Implement clustering algorithms on a given set of data sample.
4.Implement Association rule mining & web mining algorithm.
